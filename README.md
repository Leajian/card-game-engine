# Plans or future ideas, with no order
* Single-player gameplay (generalized bot implemetation)
* Multi-player (be a server or join a server)
* Implement customizable keyboard controllers
* Implement Deck class
* Serializable Deck/Card packs
* Card shop (where you upload your own cards)
* Implement scenes (Deck view, Card view, 1v1 view, etc)
* (Optional) Cards have ASCII art and when selected, they show description.
